##Linear Regression to Predict MPG
-	The variables which may provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle_length and ground_clearance. Each of these variables have a significance level between 0 and .001.  
-	The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. As the intercept is -1.040e+02, the slope of the model is negative. 
-	With a Multiple R-squared value of .71, the linear model does a fair job of predicting MechaCar prototypes. However, since ground_clearance and vehicle_length are statistically significant, it would be interesting to find out what other variables that may not be present in the dataset impact prototypes.
